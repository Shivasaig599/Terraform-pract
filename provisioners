Terraform provisioners are a mechanism within Terraform that allows for the execution of scripts or commands
on a local machine or a remote resource during the lifecycle of infrastructure provisioning or destruction. 
They are used to perform tasks that cannot be directly managed by Terraform's declarative language,
such as installing software, configuring applications or running post-deployment scripts. 


localexec:
local-exec Provisioner: This provisioner executes commands or scripts on the machine where Terraform is being run. 
This is useful for tasks that do not require interaction with the remote resource, 
such as generating configuration files or triggering local scripts after infrastructure creation.
      
      provisioner "local-exec" {
        command = "echo 'Terraform applied successfully!' >> local_log.txt"
      }
    }
      


remote-exec Provisioner: This provisioner executes commands or scripts on a remote resource after it has been created.
It typically uses SSH for Linux/Unix systems or WinRM for Windows systems to connect to the remote machine. 
This is commonly used for tasks like installing software packages, configuring services or running configuration management tools on the provisioned instance.

      provisioner "remote-exec" {
        inline = [
          "sudo apt-get update",
          "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
        ]
      }
    }
